Since then, the development of the theory of the stochastic process and its use in machine learning has been very much a Berkeley enterprise: Jim Pitman, David Aldous, and Mike Jordan are among the people involved. The restaurant analogy is due to Jim Pitman and our late colleague Lester Dubins, during one of their regular cafe meetings decades ago. Though there is a popular story that they came up with it while eating at a Chinese restaurant, in fact they were at the Strada on Bancroft and College; it was called Roma at that time. "

That's the number of different clusters observed.\n",
